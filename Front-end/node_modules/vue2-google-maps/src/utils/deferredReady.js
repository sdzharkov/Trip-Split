/**
 * 1. Create a DeferredReady plugin.
 *
 * a. Updates options.configMergeStrategies to handle our new hook correctly (using Promise.all!)
 *
 * 2. VueGoogleMaps uses a DeferredReady mixin.
 *
 *     a. Each component checks for ancestors that are also DeferredReady (via dispatch/emit)
 *     b. If no, then run DeferredReady after ready.
 *     c. If yes, then run DeferredReady after parent's deferredReady.
 *
 *
 * Say we have the following inheritance:
 *
 * --> == 'child of'
 *
 * A --> B --> C
 *
 * ready is called in the following order:
 *
 * A.ready, B.ready, C.ready
 *
 * C.ready -- no further ancestors supporting mixin, so in ready() we run+
