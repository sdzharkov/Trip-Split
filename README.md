# Trip Split 
## Django web application for the commuters and road trips 

A web application designed to help plan and assist road trip planners. The idea was originally started with the intent of easing the gas splitting for drivers and passangers. A user will select their current car from our database, select their route, and input the passengers (which will automatically allow the user to create a Venmo or Paypal request). Once the trip has been split, the user will have further cheap gas options and other events to visit while on their road trip.
